  The Cheshire Cat is a framework to build custom AIs on top of any language model. If you have ever used systems like WordPress or Django to build web apps, imagine the Cat as a similar tool, but specific for AI.

  
  Why use the Cat  

  ⚡️ API first, so you get a microservice to easily add a conversational layer to your app  

  🐘 Remembers conversations and documents and uses them in conversation  

  🚀 Extensible via plugins (public plugin registry + private plugins allowed)  

  🎚 Event callbacks, function calling (tools), conversational forms  

  🏛 Easy to use admin panel (chat, visualize memory and plugins, adjust settings)  

  🌍 Supports any language model (works with OpenAI, Google, Ollama, HuggingFace, custom services)  

  🐋 Production ready - 100% dockerized  

  👩‍👧‍👦 Active Discord community and easy to understand docs
